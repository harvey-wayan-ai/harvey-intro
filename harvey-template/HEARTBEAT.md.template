Check session status. If Claude API usage is ≥70% of limit:

2. **Alert Wayan with clear notification:**
   - "⚠️ **Model Auto-Switch**: Claude usage at X% → switching to [Model Name] via OpenRouter"
   - Include current token usage stats
   - Mention cost savings
3. Continue monitoring

**Notification format:**
