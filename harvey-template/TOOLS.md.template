# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## VibeCoding Setup

**VS Code + Continue Extension:**
- URL: `http://76.13.22.249:8080`
- Password: `94986ce1bfe5b4e956915306`
- Extension: Continue v0.0.412
- Config: `~/.continue/config.json`

**AI Models (for coding):**
- Default: MiniMax M2.1 (cheapest)
- Backups: DeepSeek V3, Llama 3.3 70B
- API Key: `sk-or-v1-1992bbfa...` (dedicated for vibecoding)

**OpenRouter API Separation:**
- **Vibecoding API** (`1992b...`) → Continue extension, coding tasks
- **LLM Fallback API** (`4ebad...`) → Harvey's fallback models when Claude hits limits
- Reason: Separate cost tracking on OpenRouter dashboard

**Workflow:**
- Simple code (<50 lines) → Harvey writes directly
- Complex apps/refactoring → Browser automation to Continue
- Continue uses cheap AI (MiniMax/DeepSeek) to save Claude tokens

## Claude Official Skills

**Location:** `/root/clawd/skills/`
**Installed:** xlsx, docx, frontend-design, mcp-builder
**Policy:** See `skills/UPDATE-POLICY.md`

**Update command:**
```
Harvey, update skills from Claude official
```

**Harvey will:**
- Auto-update if not customized
- Ask before replacing custom skills
- Report new skills available

## Notification Strategy

**Primary:** Telegram (this chat)

**Long Content/Reports:**
- Create Google Doc
- Email to: wayan@zuma.id
- Share link in Telegram

**Important Alerts (Dual):**
- Telegram message
- Email to: wayan@zuma.id

**Examples:**
- Model auto-switch → Telegram only
- Weekly report → GDoc + Email + Telegram link
- VPS alert >80% → Dual (Telegram + Email)
- Reminder → Telegram only

## Harvey Status Command

**Location:** `/root/clawd/scripts/harvey-status.sh`

Quick all-in-one status check combining VPS resources + AI model info.

**To run:**
```bash
~/clawd/scripts/harvey-status.sh
```

**When to use:**
- "Cek statusmu Harvey"
- "Harvey status"
- "Show me your status"
- Any status check question

**Shows:**
- CPU/RAM/Disk usage with status indicators
- Clawdbot service status
- Current AI model (primary + fallbacks)
- Timestamp

Harvey will automatically run this when you ask about status!

## Self-Restart Script

**Location:** `/root/clawd/restart-clawdbot.sh`

This script lets me restart myself when you ask. It's reliable — stops the daemon, waits, starts it again, verifies status, and I automatically ping you when I'm back online.

**To run:**
```bash
~/clawd/restart-clawdbot.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Stop Clawdbot daemon
2. Wait 3 seconds
3. Start daemon again
4. Verify it's running
5. I ping Telegram when ready

Guaranteed to work. I can run this when you tell me to restart.

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
