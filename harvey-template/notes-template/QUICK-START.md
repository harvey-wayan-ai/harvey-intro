## 🎯 Where Does It Go?

Quick decision tree:

```
Is it happening today?
    YES → daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
    NO → Continue...

Does it have a deadline/end date?
    YES → 1-projects/project-name.md
    NO → Continue...

Is it ongoing responsibility?
    YES → 2-areas/area-name.md
    NO → Continue...

Is it reference/learning material?
    YES → 3-resources/topic-name.md
    NO → Continue...

Is it completed/old?
    YES → 4-archives/YYYY/
```

**When in doubt:** Put it in daily note first, organize later!
